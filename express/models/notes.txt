Think about appropriate data types for components of a test case.
  Right now a test case has collections of: PreConditions, PostConditions, Steps.
  But they're all denoted by strings.

  For preconditions and postconditions use maybe boolean expressions?
    ie. Any valid javascript expression that references parts of the DOM, and resolves to a true/false value.

  For steps, use a data type that has a clear correspondent in the selenium web driver API.

It might make sense for Environment and Status to auto-populate their collections since, at least presently, they're just enumerations.
  So populate Environment with: Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari.
  And populate Status with: Scheduled, Running, Completed, Failed.
